# Rich Text to Markdown Converter

A simple browser-based tool to convert rich formatted text (from Word documents, websites, etc.) to clean Markdown.

## Usage

Just open the HTML file in your browser - no installation needed!

1. **Open** `rich-to-markdown.html` in any modern browser
2. **Paste** your rich formatted text
3. **Copy** the generated Markdown or download as `.md` file

## Features

- ✅ Professional-grade HTML → Markdown conversion using Turndown.js
- ✅ GitHub Flavored Markdown (tables, strikethrough, task lists)
- ✅ Proper HTML entity handling
- ✅ Smart quotes and Unicode support
- ✅ Nested lists and complex tables
- ✅ **All conversion happens locally in your browser** - your content never leaves your computer
- ⚠️ Requires internet connection to load the Turndown.js library from CDN (only the library code is downloaded, not your content)
